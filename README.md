# fabricated-exchange

A Fabric remake of Project E/Equivalent Exchange 2.
Each item has its own "EMC" value attached to it. Some are worth more, some less.
Transmute items and blocks into EMC, and EMC to different items you've obtained in the past.

The mod is targetting 1.19.4. Once the mod is in a stable, feature complete state, I will port it to 1.19.2, 1.18.2, 
and then 1.16.5. Afterwards it will be upgraded to whatever versions after 1.19.4 that have the most mods.

All of the assets were taken from https://github.com/sinkillerj/ProjectE.
If the author(s) of the assets do not want this project using them, I will take the project 
down until I can replace the assets myself.

# Something isn't working

You're actually wrong. Everything is working. You must be hallucinating.
In any case, open an issue on this repository.

# Contributing

This is my very first Minecraft mod, and so I am unfamiliar with good Fabric mod practices.
If you spot anything that is done incorrectly, unsafely, or that could be done more 
efficiently, please open an issue/pull request a change.

Additionally, as of now the mod is under development. So you could also suggest or implement
new features, or old features from previous equivalnce mods.

# New Features

- As much EMC as your RAM can store
- Infinitely precise EMC fractions (No more slabs without EMC values!)
