# fabricated-exchange

A Fabric remake of Project E/Equivalent Exchange 2.
Each item has its own "EMC" value attached to it. Some are worth more, some less.
Transmute items and blocks into EMC, and EMC to different items you've obtained in the past.

All of the assets were taken from https://github.com/sinkillerj/ProjectE.
If the author(s) of the assets do not want this project using them, I will take the project 
down until I can replace the assets myself.

# Something isn't working

You're actually wrong. Everything is working. You must be hallucinating.
People who hallucinate open issues on this github.

# Contributing

This is my very first Minecraft mod, and so I am unfamiliar with good Fabric mod practices.
If you spot anything that is done incorrectly, unsafely, or that could be done more 
efficiently, please open an issue/pull request a change.



# New Features

- As much EMC as your RAM can store
- Infinitely precise EMC fractions (No more slabs without EMC values!)
